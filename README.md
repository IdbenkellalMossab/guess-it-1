# Number Guessing Range Program

## Overview
This project aims to create a program that predicts the range for the next input number based on a series of previously provided numbers. The program will read numbers as input and calculate a range (lower limit and upper limit) for the next number.

## Objectives
* Implement a program that outputs a range for the next number based on the current input.
* Ensure the program maintains a history of input numbers for accurate range predictions.
* Balance the range size to optimize scoring based on accuracy.

## Instructions
* The program should read integers as standard input.
* For each number entered, it should print the predicted range for the next number in the specified format.
* The range should be determined using your logic based on the previous numbers.

## Example of Input/Output
The program should work as follows:
* Given an input series of numbers, the program prints the current number along with the predicted range for the next input.

## Testing
The program will be tested on:

* Correctness of the predicted ranges.
Performance and efficiency in calculating ranges.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will learn:

* Statistical and probability calculations.
* Scripting and file management in programming.
* Effective input/output handling in your chosen programming language.
